    <p><strong>Boncado's primary typeface is Quicksand</strong> - this font family is fun and clean. It renders smoothly in all sizes and lets the users feel at ease. Roboto, on the other hand, is the <br>
        secondary typeface. Roboto is a clean surface and goes well with the primary. It is easy to read and works well as the content font.</p>
